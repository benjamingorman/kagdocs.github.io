TCPR is the standard way to administrate a KAG server remotely through TCP. Its usage is similar to that of RCON, accessed from the `/rcon` command in KAG's built-in console (home key).

You can find an [(outdated) documentation of TCPR](https://wiki.kag2d.com/wiki/Remote_Administration) on the KAG Wiki.  
KAG build [`1591`](https://forum.thd.vg/threads/kag-build-1591-maps-and-bombs.24220)(?) came up with overhauled TCPR with more capabilities (such as now being Windows-compatible) and build [`1865`](https://forum.thd.vg/threads/build-1865-engine-update-sponges-in-tdm-windows-modded-server-fixes.25483) came up with a TCPR maximal line size change.
