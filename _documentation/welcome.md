Welcome to the King Arthur's Gold community-driven documentation!

This documentation aims to cover the scripting API exposed by the Crismon Engine used by KAG, documentation over KAG scripts. It also aims to cover the REST API which allows getting information over players and servers, and others features such as TCPR.

Please do note that this documentation is under heavy work. It is therefore not complete and some information might be false.  
In the mean time, you can help contribute or refer to the `Manual` folder in KAG and to the [official online documentation](doc.kag2d.com).
{: .warning }

KAG uses AngelScript [`2.27.1`](http://www.angelcode.com/angelscript/sdk/docs/articles/changes2.html) as a scripting language. You may find documentation for it [here](http://www.angelcode.com/angelscript/sdk/docs/manual/doc_script.html).
