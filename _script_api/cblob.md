CBlob is the basic entity type. Blobs can be created using `server_CreateBlob`, but cannot be constructed directly, and so is only accessed through a handle.  
CBlob can hold various classes required for creating an entity in the game, including shapes, a sprite, etc. and can be bound to a CPlayer.
