`float` angle
: The angle in degrees to apply to the blob.

The angle can still be set though the `CShape` rotations are disabled (through `CShape::SetRotationsAllowed`).  
{: .info }

This function has to be called client-side as well when handling player blobs, otherwise only other players will see the sprite rotated.
{: .info }

A positive angle value will rotate the blob clockwise.
